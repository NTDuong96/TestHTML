    <h1 style='color:palevioletred;'><strong>From Garden to Plate</strong></h1>
        <p style='color:yellowgreen;'>A <em>potager</em> is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.</p>
      <h2 style='color:palevioletred;'><strong>What to Plant</strong></h2>
          <p style='color:yellowgreen;'>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form. Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
